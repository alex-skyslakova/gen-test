3636,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/100_doors,100 doors,"There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.

You make 100 passes by the doors.

The first time through, visit every door and  toggle  the door  (if the door is closed,  open it;   if it is open,  close it).

The second time, only visit every 2nd door   (door #2, #4, #6, ...),   and toggle it.

The third time, visit every 3rd door   (door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc,   until you only visit the 100th door.



Task

Answer the question:   what state are the doors in after the last pass?   Which are open, which are closed?


Alternate:
As noted in this page's   discussion page,   the only doors that remain open are those whose numbers are perfect squares.

Opening only those doors is an   optimization   that may also be expressed;
however, as should be obvious, this defeats the intent of comparing implementations across programming languages.

The Problem

 100 prisoners are individually numbered 1 to 100
 A room having a cupboard of 100 opaque drawers numbered 1 to 100, that cannot be seen from outside.
 Cards numbered 1 to 100 are placed randomly, one to a drawer, and the drawers all closed; at the start.
 Prisoners start outside the room
 They can decide some strategy before any enter the room.
 Prisoners enter the room one by one, can open a drawer, inspect the card number in the drawer, then close the drawer.
 A prisoner can open no more than 50 drawers.
 A prisoner tries to find his own number.
 A prisoner finding his own number is then held apart from the others.
 If all 100 prisoners find their own numbers then they will all be pardoned. If any don't then all sentences stand. 


The task

 Simulate several thousand instances of the game where the prisoners randomly open drawers
 Simulate several thousand instances of the game where the prisoners use the optimal strategy mentioned in the Wikipedia article, of:
 First opening the drawer whose outside number is his prisoner number.
 If the card within has his number then he succeeds otherwise he opens the drawer with the same number as that of the revealed card. (until he opens his maximum).


Show and compare the computed probabilities of success for the two strategies, here, on this page.

Task
Write a program that randomly chooses and displays four digits, each from 1 ──► 9 (inclusive) with repetitions allowed.

The program should prompt for the player to enter an arithmetic expression using just those, and all of those four digits, used exactly once each. The program should check then evaluate the expression.

The goal is for the player to enter an expression that (numerically) evaluates to 24.

 Only the following operators/functions are allowed: multiplication, division, addition, subtraction
 Division should use floating point or rational arithmetic, etc, to preserve remainders.
 Brackets are allowed, if using an infix expression evaluator.
 Forming multiple digit numbers from the supplied digits is disallowed. (So an answer of 12+12 when given 1, 2, 2, and 1 is wrong).
 The order of the digits when given does not have to be preserved.


Notes
 The type of expression evaluator used is not mandated. An RPN evaluator is equally acceptable for example.
 The task is not for the program to generate the expression, or test whether an expression is even possible.

Write a function that takes a string (word) and determines whether the word can be spelled with the given collection of blocks.



The rules are simple:

   Once a letter on a block is used that block cannot be used again
   The function should be case-insensitive

76954,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/AKS_test_for_primes,AKS test for primes,"The AKS algorithm for testing whether a number is prime is a polynomial-time algorithm based on an elementary theorem about Pascal triangles.

The theorem on which the test is based can be stated as follows:

   a number   



p


{\displaystyle p}

   is prime   if and only if   all the coefficients of the polynomial expansion of
 



(
x
−
1

)

p


−
(

x

p


−
1
)


{\displaystyle (x-1)^{p}-(x^{p}-1)}


are divisible by   



p


{\displaystyle p}

.



Example

Using   



p
=
3


{\displaystyle p=3}

:

         (x-1)^3 - (x^3 - 1)
            = (x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1) - (x^3 - 1)
            = -3x^2 + 3x



And all the coefficients are divisible by 3,   so 3 is prime.





 Note:
This task is not the AKS primality test.   It is an inefficient exponential time algorithm discovered in the late 1600s and used as an introductory lemma in the AKS derivation.



Task



 Create a function/subroutine/method that given   



p


{\displaystyle p}

   generates the coefficients of the expanded polynomial representation of   



(
x
−
1

)

p




{\displaystyle (x-1)^{p}}

.
 Use the function to show here the polynomial expansions of   



(
x
−
1

)

p




{\displaystyle (x-1)^{p}}

   for   



p


{\displaystyle p}

   in the range   0   to at least   7,   inclusive.
 Use the previous function in creating another function that when given   



p


{\displaystyle p}

   returns whether   



p


{\displaystyle p}

   is prime using the theorem.
 Use your test to generate a list of all primes under   35.
 As a stretch goal,   generate all primes under   50   (needs integers larger than 31-bit).

Caveat:   The list (above) most surely contains errors (or, at the least, differences) of what the actual (or true) names for the days-of-the-week.



To make this Rosetta Code task page as small as possible, if processing the complete list, read the days-of-the-week from a file (that is created from the above list).



Notes concerning the above list of words

   each line has a list of days-of-the-week for a language, separated by at least one blank
   the words on each line happen to be in order, from Sunday ──► Saturday
   most lines have words in mixed case and some have all manner of accented words and other characters
   some words were translated to the nearest character that was available to code page   437
   the characters in the words are not restricted except that they may not have imbedded blanks
   for this example, the use of an underscore (_) was used to indicate a blank in a word


Task

   The list of words   (days of the week)   needn't be verified/validated.
   Write a function to find the (numeric) minimum length abbreviation for each line that would make abbreviations unique.
   A blank line   (or a null line)   should return a null string.
   Process and show the output for at least the first five lines of the file.
   Show all output here.

   o,   ov,   oVe,   over,   overL,   overla   are all acceptable abbreviations for   overlay 1
   if there isn't a number after the command,   then there isn't an abbreviation permitted


Task

   The command table needn't be verified/validated.
   Write a function to validate if the user ""words""   (given as input)   are valid   (in the command table).
   If the word   is   valid,   then return the full uppercase version of that ""word"".
   If the word isn't valid,   then return the lowercase string:    *error*        (7 characters).
   A blank input   (or a null input)   should return a null string.
   Show all output here.


An example test case to be used for this task

For a user string of:

 riG   rePEAT copies  put mo   rest    types   fup.    6       poweRin

the computer program should return the string:

 RIGHT REPEAT *error* PUT MOVE RESTORE *error* *error* *error* POWERINPUT

76738,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Active_object,Active object,"In object-oriented programming an object is active when its state depends on clock. Usually an active object encapsulates a task that updates the object's state. To the outer world the object looks like a normal object with methods that can be called from outside. Implementation of such methods must have a certain synchronization mechanism with the encapsulated task in order to prevent object's state corruption.

A typical instance of an active object is an animation widget. The widget state changes with the time, while as an object it has all properties of a normal widget.

The task

Implement an active integrator object. The object has an input and output. The input can be set using the method Input. The input is a function of time. The output can be queried using the method Output. The object integrates its input over the time and the result becomes the object's output. So if the input is K(t) and the output is S, the object state S is changed to S + (K(t1) + K(t0)) * (t1 - t0) / 2, i.e. it integrates K using the trapeze method. Initially K is constant 0 and S is 0.

In order to test the object:

 set its input to sin (2π f t), where the frequency f=0.5Hz. The phase is irrelevant.
 wait 2s
 set the input to constant 0
 wait 0.5s
Verify that now the object's output is approximately 0 (the sine has the period of 2s). The accuracy of the result will depend on the OS scheduler time slicing and the accuracy of the clock.

75702,"http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Angles_(geometric),_normalization_and_conversion","Angles (geometric), normalization and conversion","This task is about the normalization and/or conversion of (geometric) angles using
some common scales.



The angular scales that will be used in this task are:

   degree
   gradian
   mil
   radian


Definitions

The angular scales used or referenced here:

   turn   is a full turn or 360 degrees, also shown as 360º
   degree   is   1/360   of a turn
   gradian   is   1/400   of a turn
   mil   is   1/6400   of a turn
   radian   is   1/2



π


{\displaystyle \pi }

   of a turn   (or   0.5/



π


{\displaystyle \pi }

   of a turn)


Or, to put it another way,   for a full circle:

   there are   360   degrees
   there are   400   gradians
   there are   6,400   mils
   there are   2



π


{\displaystyle \pi }

   radians   (roughly equal to 6.283+)


A   mil   is approximately equal to a   milliradian   (which is   1/1000   of a radian).

There is another definition of a   mil   which
is   1/1000   of a radian   ─── this
definition won't be used in this Rosetta Code task.


Turns   are sometimes known or shown as:

   turn(s)
   360 degrees
   unit circle
   a (full) circle

Degrees   are sometimes known or shown as:

   degree(s)
   deg
   º       (a symbol)
   °       (another symbol)

Gradians   are sometimes known or shown as:

   gradian(s)
   grad(s)
   grade(s)
   gon(s)
   metric degree(s)
   (Note that   centigrade   was used for 1/100th of a grade, see the note below.)

Mils   are sometimes known or shown as:

   mil(s)
   NATO mil(s)

Radians   are sometimes known or shown as:

   radian(s)
   rad(s)


Notes

In continental Europe, the French term   centigrade   was used
for   1/100   of a grad (grade);   this was
one reason for the adoption of the term   Celsius   to
replace   centigrade   as the name of a temperature scale.

Gradians were commonly used in civil engineering.

Mils were normally used for artillery   (elevations of the gun barrel for ranging).



Positive and negative angles

Although the definition of the measurement of an angle doesn't support the
concept of a negative angle,   it's frequently useful to impose a convention that
allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and/or rotations
in opposite directions relative to some reference.   It is this reason that
negative angles will keep their sign and not be normalized to positive angles.



Normalization

Normalization   (for this Rosetta Code task)   will keep the same
sign,   but it will reduce the magnitude to less than a full circle;   in
other words, less than 360º.

Normalization   shouldn't   change   -45º   to   315º,

An angle of   0º,   +0º,   0.000000,   or   -0º   should be
shown as   0º.



Task

   write a function (or equivalent) to do the normalization for each scale
 Suggested names:
 d2d,   g2g,   m2m,   and  r2r
   write a function (or equivalent) to convert one scale to another
 Suggested names for comparison of different computer language function names:
 d2g,   d2m,   and   d2r   for degrees
 g2d,   g2m,   and   g2r   for gradians
 m2d,   m2g,   and   m2r   for mils
 r2d,   r2g,   and   r2m   for radians
   normalize all angles used   (except for the ""original"" or ""base"" angle)
   show the angles in every scale and convert them to all other scales

Animation is integral to many parts of GUIs, including both the fancy effects when things change used in window managers, and of course games.   The core of any animation system is a scheme for periodically changing the display while still remaining responsive to the user.   This task demonstrates this.



Task

Create a window containing the string ""Hello World! "" (the trailing space is significant).

Make the text appear to be rotating right by periodically removing one letter from the end of the string and attaching it to the front.

When the user clicks on the (windowed) text, it should reverse its direction.

Task[edit]
Create a stateful function/class/instance that takes a period and returns a routine that takes a number as argument and returns a simple moving average of its arguments so far.

Description
A simple moving average is a method for computing an average of a stream of numbers by only averaging the last   P   numbers from the stream,   where   P   is known as the period.

It can be implemented by calling an initialing routine with   P   as its argument,   I(P),   which should then return a routine that when called with individual, successive members of a stream of numbers, computes the mean of (up to), the last   P   of them, lets call this   SMA().

The word   stateful   in the task description refers to the need for   SMA()   to remember certain information between calls to it:

   The period,   P
   An ordered container of at least the last   P   numbers from each of its individual calls.

Stateful   also means that successive calls to   I(),   the initializer,   should return separate routines that do   not   share saved state so they could be used on two independent streams of data.

Pseudo-code for an implementation of   SMA   is:

function SMA(number: N):
    stateful integer: P
    stateful list:    stream
    number:           average

    stream.append_last(N)
    if stream.length() > P:
        # Only average the last P elements of the stream
        stream.delete_first()
    if stream.length() == 0:
        average = 0
    else:    
        average = sum( stream.values() ) / stream.length()
    return average

 This page uses content from Wikipedia. The original article was at Benford's_law. The list of authors can be seen in the page history. As with Rosetta Code, the text of Wikipedia is available under the GNU FDL. (See links for details on variance)


Benford's law, also called the first-digit law, refers to the frequency distribution of digits in many (but not all) real-life sources of data.

In this distribution, the number 1 occurs as the first digit about 30% of the time, while larger numbers occur in that position less frequently: 9 as the first digit less than 5% of the time. This distribution of first digits is the same as the widths of gridlines on a logarithmic scale.

Benford's law also concerns the expected distribution for digits beyond the first, which approach a uniform distribution.

This result has been found to apply to a wide variety of data sets, including electricity bills, street addresses, stock prices, population numbers, death rates, lengths of rivers, physical and mathematical constants, and processes described by power laws (which are very common in nature). It tends to be most accurate when values are distributed across multiple orders of magnitude.

A set of numbers is said to satisfy Benford's law if the leading digit

{\displaystyle P(d)=\log _{10}(d+1)-\log _{10}(d)=\log _{10}\left(1+{\frac {1}{d}}\right)}


For this task, write (a) routine(s) to calculate the distribution of first significant (non-zero) digits in a collection of numbers, then display the actual vs. expected distribution in the way most convenient for your language (table / graph / histogram / whatever).

Use the first 1000 numbers from the Fibonacci sequence as your data set. No need to show how the Fibonacci numbers are obtained.

You can generate them or load them from a file; whichever is easiest.

Display your actual vs expected distribution.


For extra credit: Show the distribution for one other set of numbers from a page on Wikipedia. State which Wikipedia page it can be obtained from and what the set enumerates. Again, no need to display the actual list of numbers or the code to load them.

Shuffle the characters of a string in such a way that as many of the character values are in a different position as possible.

A shuffle that produces a randomized result among the best choices is to be preferred. A deterministic approach that produces the same sequence every time is acceptable as an alternative.

Display the result as follows:

The score gives the number of positions whose character value did not change.

Task

Write a program that takes a bitcoin address as argument,
and checks whether or not this address is valid.

A bitcoin address uses a base58 encoding, which uses an alphabet of the characters 0 .. 9, A ..Z, a .. z, but without the four characters:

   0   zero
   O   uppercase oh
   I   uppercase eye
   l   lowercase ell


With this encoding, a bitcoin address encodes 25 bytes:

 the first byte is the version number, which will be zero for this task ;
 the next twenty bytes are a RIPEMD-160 digest, but you don't have to know that for this task: you can consider them a pure arbitrary data ;
 the last four bytes are a checksum check. They are the first four bytes of a double SHA-256 digest of the previous 21 bytes.


To check the bitcoin address, you must read the first twenty-one bytes, compute the checksum, and check that it corresponds to the last four bytes.

The program can either return a boolean value or throw an exception when not valid.

You can use a digest library for SHA-256.

Task

Generate and draw a   Brownian Tree.



A Brownian Tree is generated as a result of an initial seed, followed by the interaction of two processes.

 The initial ""seed"" is placed somewhere within the field. Where is not particularly important; it could be randomized, or it could be a fixed point.
 Particles are injected into the field, and are individually given a (typically random) motion pattern.
 When a particle collides with the seed or tree, its position is fixed, and it's considered to be part of the tree.

Because of the lax rules governing the random nature of the particle's placement and motion, no two resulting trees are really expected to be the same, or even necessarily have the same general shape.

Show one or more idiomatic ways of generating the Cartesian product of two arbitrary lists in your language.

Demonstrate that your function/method correctly returns:

{1, 2} × {3, 4} = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}
and, in contrast:

{3, 4} × {1, 2} = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)}
Also demonstrate, using your function/method, that the product of an empty list with any other list is empty.

 {1, 2} × {} = {}
 {} × {1, 2} = {}
For extra credit, show or write a function returning the n-ary product of an arbitrary number of lists, each of arbitrary length. Your function might, for example, accept a single argument which is itself a list of lists, and return the n-ary product of those lists.

Use your n-ary Cartesian product function to show the following products:

Task
Play the Chaos Game using the corners of an equilateral triangle as the reference points.   Add a starting point at random (preferably inside the triangle).   Then add the next point halfway between the starting point and one of the reference points.   This reference point is chosen at random.

After a sufficient number of iterations, the image of a Sierpinski Triangle should emerge.

68658,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Checkpoint_synchronization,Checkpoint synchronization,"The checkpoint synchronization is a problem of synchronizing multiple tasks. Consider a workshop where several workers (tasks) assembly details of some mechanism. When each of them completes his work they put the details together. There is no store, so a worker who finished its part first must wait for others before starting another one. Putting details together is the checkpoint at which tasks synchronize themselves before going their paths apart.

The task

Implement checkpoint synchronization in your language.

Make sure that the solution is race condition-free. Note that a straightforward solution based on events is exposed to race condition. Let two tasks A and B need to be synchronized at a checkpoint. Each signals its event (EA and EB correspondingly), then waits for the AND-combination of the events (EA&EB) and resets its event. Consider the following scenario: A signals EA first and gets blocked waiting for EA&EB. Then B signals EB and loses the processor. Then A is released (both events are signaled) and resets EA. Now if B returns and enters waiting for EA&EB, it gets lost.

When a worker is ready it shall not continue before others finish. A typical implementation bug is when a worker is counted twice within one working cycle causing its premature completion. This happens when the quickest worker serves its cycle two times while the laziest one is lagging behind.

If you can, implement workers joining and leaving.

69038,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac,Chinese zodiac,"Traditionally, the Chinese have counted years using two simultaneous cycles, one of length 10 (the ""celestial stems"") and one of length 12 (the ""terrestrial branches""); the combination results in a repeating 60-year pattern. Mapping the branches to twelve traditional animal deities results in the well-known ""Chinese zodiac"", assigning each year to a given animal. For example, Tuesday, February 1, 2022 CE (in the common Gregorian calendar) will begin the lunisolar Year of the Tiger.

The celestial stems have no one-to-one mapping like that of the branches to animals; however, the five pairs of consecutive stems each belong to one of the five traditional Chinese elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water). Further, one of the two years within each element's governance is associated with yin, the other with yang.

Thus, 2022 is also the yang year of Water. Note that since 12 is an even number, the association between animals and yin/yang doesn't change. Consecutive Years of the Rooster will cycle through the five elements, but will always be yin, despite the apparent conceptual mismatch between the specifically-male English animal name and the female aspect denoted by yin.

Task
 Create a subroutine or program that will return or output the animal, yin/yang association, and element for the lunisolar year that begins in a given CE year.
You may optionally provide more information in the form of the year's numerical position within the 60-year cycle and/or its actual Chinese stem-branch name (in Han characters or Pinyin transliteration).

Requisite information

 The animal cycle runs in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.
 The element cycle runs in this order: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water.
 The yang year precedes the yin year within each element.
 The current 60-year cycle began in 1984 CE; the first cycle of the Common Era began in 4 CE.
Thus, 1984 was the year of the Wood Rat (yang), 1985 was the year of the Wood Ox (yin), and 1986 the year of the Fire Tiger (yang); 2022 - which, as already noted, is the year of the Water Tiger (yang) - is the 39th year of the current cycle.

Information for optional task

 The ten celestial stems are 甲 jiă, 乙 yĭ, 丙 bĭng, 丁 dīng, 戊 wù, 己 jĭ, 庚 gēng, 辛 xīn, 壬 rén, and 癸 gŭi. With the ASCII version of Pinyin tones, the names are written ""jia3"", ""yi3"", ""bing3"", ""ding1"", ""wu4"", ""ji3"", ""geng1"", ""xin1"", ""ren2"", and ""gui3"".
 The twelve terrestrial branches are 子 zĭ, 丑 chŏu, 寅 yín, 卯 măo, 辰 chén, 巳 sì, 午 wŭ, 未 wèi, 申 shēn, 酉 yŏu, 戌 xū, 亥 hài. In ASCII Pinyin, those are ""zi3"", ""chou3"", ""yin2"", ""mao3"", ""chen2"", ""si4"", ""wu3"", ""wei4"", ""shen1"", ""you3"", ""xu1"", and ""hai4"".
Therefore 1984 was 甲子 (jiă-zĭ, or jia3-zi3). 2022 is 壬寅 (rén-yín or ren2-yin2).

Given two points on a plane and a radius, usually two circles of given radius can be drawn through the points.

Exceptions

 r==0.0 should be treated as never describing circles (except in the case where the points are coincident).
 If the points are coincident then an infinite number of circles with the point on their circumference can be drawn, unless r==0.0 as well which then collapses the circles to a point.
 If the points form a diameter then return two identical circles or return a single circle, according to which is the most natural mechanism for the implementation language.
 If the points are too far apart then no circles can be drawn.


Task detail

 Write a function/subroutine/method/... that takes two points and a radius and returns the two circles through those points, or some indication of special cases where two, possibly equal, circles cannot be returned.
 Show here the output for the following inputs:
      p1                p2           r

68215,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Cistercian_numerals,Cistercian numerals,"Cistercian numerals were used across Europe by Cistercian monks during the Late Medieval Period as an alternative to Roman numerals. They were used to represent base 10 integers from 0 to 9999.

How they work
All Cistercian numerals begin with a vertical line segment, which by itself represents the number 0. Then, glyphs representing the digits 1 through 9 are optionally added to the four quadrants surrounding the vertical line segment. These glyphs are drawn with vertical and horizontal symmetry about the initial line segment. Each quadrant corresponds to a digit place in the number:

 The upper-right quadrant represents the ones place.
 The upper-left quadrant represents the tens place.
 The lower-right quadrant represents the hundreds place.
 The lower-left quadrant represents the thousands place.
Please consult the following image for examples of Cistercian numerals showing each glyph: [1]

Task
 Write a function/procedure/routine to display any given Cistercian numeral. This could be done by drawing to the display, creating an image, or even as text (as long as it is a reasonable facsimile).
 Use the routine to show the following Cistercian numerals:
 0
 1
 20
 300
 4000
 5555
 6789
 And a number of your choice!

Due to the inability to upload images to Rosetta Code as of this task's creation, showing output here on this page is not required. However, it is welcomed — especially for text output.

66724,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Commatizing_numbers,Commatizing numbers,"Commatizing   numbers (as used here, is a handy expedient made-up word) is the act of adding commas to a number (or string), or to the numeric part of a larger string.



Task

Write a function that takes a string as an argument with optional arguments or parameters (the format of parameters/options is left to the programmer) that in general, adds commas (or some
other characters, including blanks or tabs) to the first numeric part of a string (if it's suitable for commatizing as per the rules below), and returns that newly commatized string.

Some of the commatizing rules (specified below) are arbitrary, but they'll be a part of this task requirements, if only to make the results consistent amongst national preferences and other disciplines.

The number may be part of a larger (non-numeric) string such as:

   «US$1744 millions»       ──or──
   ±25000 motes.


The string may possibly not have a number suitable for commatizing, so it should be untouched and no error generated.

If any argument (option) is invalid, nothing is changed and no error need be generated (quiet execution, no fail execution).   Error message generation is optional.

The exponent part of a number is never commatized.   The following string isn't suitable for commatizing:   9.7e+12000

Leading zeroes are never commatized.   The string   0000000005714.882   after commatization is:   0000000005,714.882

Any   period   (.)   in a number is assumed to be a   decimal point.

The original string is never changed   except   by the addition of commas   [or whatever character(s) is/are used for insertion], if at all.

To wit, the following should be preserved:

   leading signs (+, -)       ── even superfluous signs
   leading/trailing/embedded blanks, tabs, and other whitespace 
   the case (upper/lower) of the exponent indicator, e.g.:   4.8903d-002


Any exponent character(s) should be supported:

   1247e12
   57256.1D-4
   4444^60
   7500∙10**35
   8500x10**35
   9500↑35
   +55000↑3
   1000**100
   2048²
   409632
   10000pow(pi)

Numbers may be terminated with any non-digit character, including subscripts and/or superscript:   41421356243   or   7320509076(base 24).

The character(s) to be used for the comma can be specified, and may contain blanks, tabs, and other whitespace characters, as well as multiple characters.   The default is the comma (,) character.

The   period length   can be specified   (sometimes referred to as ""thousands"" or ""thousands separators"").   The   period length   can be defined as the length (or number) of the decimal digits between commas.   The default period length is   3.

 E.G.:   in this example, the   period length   is five:   56789,12340,14148
The location of where to start the scanning for the target field (the numeric part) should be able to be specified.   The default is   1.

67461,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life,Conway's Game of Life,"The Game of Life is a   cellular automaton   devised by the British mathematician   John Horton Conway   in 1970.   It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.

Conway's game of life is described   here:

A cell   C   is represented by a   1   when alive,   or   0   when dead,   in an   m-by-m   (or m×m)   square array of cells.

We calculate   N   - the sum of live cells in C's   eight-location neighbourhood,   then cell   C   is alive or dead in the next generation based on the following table:

   C   N                 new C
   1   0,1             ->  0  # Lonely
   1   4,5,6,7,8       ->  0  # Overcrowded
   1   2,3             ->  1  # Lives
   0   3               ->  1  # It takes three to give birth!
   0   0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8 ->  0  # Barren

Assume cells beyond the boundary are always dead.

The ""game"" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players.   One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.



Task

Although you should test your implementation on more complex examples such as the   glider   in a larger universe,   show the action of the blinker   (three adjoining cells in a row all alive),   over three generations, in a 3 by 3 grid.

Some definitions of cuban primes

   primes which are the difference of two consecutive cubes.
   primes of the form:   (n+1)3 - n3.
   primes of the form:   n3 - (n-1)3.
   primes   p   such that   n2(p+n)   is a cube for some   n>0.
   primes   p   such that   4p = 1 + 3n2.


Cuban primes were named in 1923 by Allan Joseph Champneys Cunningham.

Show how to represent currency in a simple example, using a data type that represent exact values of dollars and cents.



Note

The IEEE 754 binary floating point representations of numbers like   2.86   and   .0765   are not exact.

For this example, data will be two items with prices in dollars and cents, a quantity for each, and a tax rate.

Use the values:

 4000000000000000 hamburgers at $5.50 each       (four quadrillion burgers)
 2 milkshakes at $2.86 each, and 
 a tax rate of 7.65%. 


(That number of hamburgers is a 4 with 15 zeros after it.   The number is contrived to exclude naïve task solutions using 64 bit floating point types.)

Compute and output (show results on this page):

 the total price before tax
 the tax
 the total with tax 


The tax value must be computed by rounding to the nearest whole cent and this exact value must be added to the total price before tax.

The output must show dollars and cents with a decimal point.

The three results displayed should be:

 22000000000000005.72
 1683000000000000.44 
 23683000000000006.16

This version introduced 32000 numbered deals. (The FreeCell FAQ tells this history.)

As the game became popular, Jim Horne disclosed the algorithm, and other implementations of FreeCell began to reproduce the Microsoft deals. 

These deals are numbered from 1 to 32000.
Newer versions from Microsoft have 1 million deals, numbered from 1 to 1000000; some implementations allow numbers outside that range.

The algorithm uses this linear congruential generator from Microsoft C:

{\displaystyle rand_{n}}

 is in range 0 to 32767.
 Rosetta Code has another task, linear congruential generator, with code for this RNG in several languages.


The algorithm follows:

 Seed the RNG with the number of the deal.
 Create an array of 52 cards: Ace of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, Ace of Hearts, Ace of Spades, 2 of Clubs, 2 of Diamonds, and so on through the ranks: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King. The array indexes are 0 to 51, with Ace of Clubs at 0, and King of Spades at 51.
 Until the array is empty:
 Choose a random card at index ≡ next random number (mod array length).
 Swap this random card with the last card of the array.
 Remove this random card from the array. (Array length goes down by 1.)
 Deal this random card.
 Deal all 52 cards, face up, across 8 columns. The first 8 cards go in 8 columns, the next 8 cards go on the first 8 cards, and so on.

Demonstrate how to copy data structures containing complex heterogeneous and cyclic semantics.

This is often referred to as deep copying, and is normally required where structures are mutable and to ensure that independent copies can be manipulated without side-effects.

If this facility is not built into the language, it is permissible to use functions from a common library, or a coded procedure.



The task should show:

 Relevant semantics of structures, such as their homogeneous or heterogeneous properties, or containment of (self- or mutual-reference) cycles.
 Any limitations of the method.
 That the structure and its copy are different.
 Suitable links to external documentation for common libraries.

62485,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm,Dijkstra's algorithm,"This task has been clarified. Its programming examples are in need of review to ensure that they still fit the requirements of the task.

Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956 and published in 1959, is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree.

This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.



For a given source vertex (node) in the graph, the algorithm finds the path with lowest cost (i.e. the shortest path) between that vertex and every other vertex.



For instance

If the vertices of the graph represent cities and edge path costs represent driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road,   Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities.

As a result, the shortest path first is widely used in network routing protocols, most notably:

   IS-IS   (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)   and 
   OSPF   (Open Shortest Path First).


Important note
 
The inputs to Dijkstra's algorithm are a directed and weighted graph consisting of 2 or more nodes, generally represented by:

   an adjacency matrix or list,   and
   a start node. 


A destination node is not specified.

The output is a set of edges depicting the shortest path to each destination node.



An example, starting with

                                         a──►b,  cost=7,   lastNode=a  
                                         a──►c,  cost=9,   lastNode=a 
                                         a──►d,  cost=NA,  lastNode=a
                                         a──►e,  cost=NA,  lastNode=a 
                                         a──►f,  cost=14,  lastNode=a
 
    The lowest cost is    a──►b    so    a──►b    is added to the output. 
 
    There is a connection from   b──►d   so the input is updated to: 
                                         a──►c,  cost=9,   lastNode=a 
                                         a──►d,  cost=22,  lastNode=b 
                                         a──►e,  cost=NA,  lastNode=a 
                                         a──►f,  cost=14,  lastNode=a
 
    The lowest cost is    a──►c    so    a──►c    is added to the output. 
 
    Paths to    d    and    f    are cheaper via    c    so the input is updated to:
                                         a──►d,  cost=20,  lastNode=c 
                                         a──►e,  cost=NA,  lastNode=a 
                                         a──►f,  cost=11,  lastNode=c
 
    The lowest cost is    a──►f    so    c──►f    is added to the output. 
 
    The input is updated to:
                                         a──►d,  cost=20,  lastNode=c 
                                         a──►e,  cost=NA,  lastNode=a
 
    The lowest cost is    a──►d    so    c──►d    is added to the output. 
 
    There is a connection from    d──►e    so the input is updated to:
                                         a──►e,  cost=26,  lastNode=d
 
    Which just leaves adding    d──►e    to the output.
 
    The output should now be:
                                       [ d──►e
                                         c──►d
                                         c──►f
                                         a──►c
                                         a──►b ]

   Baker does not live on the top floor.
   Cooper does not live on the bottom floor. 
   Fletcher does not live on either the top or the bottom floor.
   Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper.
   Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher's. 
   Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper's.

61491,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Diversity_prediction_theorem,Diversity prediction theorem,"The   wisdom of the crowd   is the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than that of a single expert.

Wisdom-of-the-crowds research routinely attributes the superiority of crowd averages over individual judgments to the elimination of individual noise,   an explanation that assumes independence of the individual judgments from each other.

Thus the crowd tends to make its best decisions if it is made up of diverse opinions and ideologies.



Scott E. Page introduced the diversity prediction theorem:

 The squared error of the collective prediction equals the average squared error minus the predictive diversity. 


Therefore,   when the diversity in a group is large,   the error of the crowd is small.



Definitions

   Average Individual Error:   Average of the individual squared errors
   Collective Error:   Squared error of the collective prediction
   Prediction Diversity:   Average squared distance from the individual predictions to the collective prediction
   Diversity Prediction Theorem:   Given a crowd of predictive models,     then
   Collective Error   =   Average Individual Error   ─   Prediction Diversity
Task

For a given   true   value and a number of number of estimates (from a crowd),   show   (here on this page):

   the true value   and   the crowd estimates
   the average error
   the crowd error
   the prediction diversity


Use   (at least)   these two examples:

   a true value of   49   with crowd estimates of:    48   47   51
   a true value of   49   with crowd estimates of:    48   47   51   42

Create and display a dragon curve fractal.

(You may either display the curve directly or write it to an image file.)



Algorithms
Here are some brief notes the algorithms used and how they might suit various languages.

 Recursively a right curling dragon is a right dragon followed by a left dragon, at 90-degree angle. And a left dragon is a left followed by a right.
*---R----*     expands to     *       *
                               \     /
                                R   L
                                 \ /
                                  *

                                  *
                                 / \
                                L   R
                               /     \
*---L---*      expands to     *       *
 The co-routines dcl and dcr in various examples do this recursively to a desired expansion level.
 The curl direction right or left can be a parameter instead of two separate routines.
 Recursively, a curl direction can be eliminated by noting the dragon consists of two copies of itself drawn towards a central point at 45-degrees.
*------->*   becomes    *       *     Recursive copies drawn
                         \     /      from the ends towards
                          \   /       the centre.
                           v v
                            *
 This can be seen in the SVG example. This is best suited to off-line drawing since the reversal in the second half means the drawing jumps backward and forward (in binary reflected Gray code order) which is not very good for a plotter or for drawing progressively on screen.
 Successive approximation repeatedly re-writes each straight line as two new segments at a right angle,
                       *       
*-----*   becomes     / \      bend to left
                     /   \     if N odd
                    *     *

                    *     *   
*-----*   becomes    \   /     bend to right  
                      \ /      if N even 
                       *
 Numbering from the start of the curve built so far, if the segment is at an odd position then the bend introduced is on the right side. If the segment is an even position then on the left. The process is then repeated on the new doubled list of segments. This constructs a full set of line segments before any drawing.
 The effect of the splitting is a kind of bottom-up version of the recursions. See the Asymptote example for code doing this.
 Iteratively the curve always turns 90-degrees left or right at each point. The direction of the turn is given by the bit above the lowest 1-bit of n. Some bit-twiddling can extract that efficiently.
n = 1010110000
        ^
        bit above lowest 1-bit, turn left or right as 0 or 1

LowMask = n BITXOR (n-1)   # eg. giving 0000011111
AboveMask = LowMask + 1    # eg. giving 0000100000
BitAboveLowestOne = n BITAND AboveMask
 The first turn is at n=1, so reckon the curve starting at the origin as n=0 then a straight line segment to position n=1 and turn there.
 If you prefer to reckon the first turn as n=0 then take the bit above the lowest 0-bit instead. This works because ""...10000"" minus 1 is ""...01111"" so the lowest 0 in n-1 is where the lowest 1 in n is.
 Going by turns suits turtle graphics such as Logo or a plotter drawing with a pen and current direction.
 If a language doesn't maintain a ""current direction"" for drawing then you can always keep that separately and apply turns by bit-above-lowest-1.
 Absolute direction to move at point n can be calculated by the number of bit-transitions in n.
n = 11 00 1111 0 1
      ^  ^    ^ ^     4 places where change bit value
                      so direction=4*90degrees=East
 This can be calculated by counting the number of 1 bits in ""n XOR (n RIGHTSHIFT 1)"" since such a shift and xor leaves a single 1 bit at each position where two adjacent bits differ.
 Absolute X,Y coordinates of a point n can be calculated in complex numbers by some powers (i+1)^k and add/subtract/rotate. This is done in the gnuplot code. This might suit things similar to Gnuplot which want to calculate each point independently.
 Predicate test for whether a given X,Y point or segment is on the curve can be done. This might suit line-by-line output rather than building an entire image before printing. See M4 for an example of this.
 A predicate works by dividing out complex number i+1 until reaching the origin, so it takes roughly a bit at a time from X and Y is thus quite efficient. Why it works is slightly subtle but the calculation is not difficult. (Check segment by applying an offset to move X,Y to an ""even"" position before dividing i+1. Check vertex by whether the segment either East or West is on the curve.)
 The number of steps in the predicate corresponds to doublings of the curve, so stopping the check at say 8 steps can limit the curve drawn to 2^8=256 points. The offsets arising in the predicate are bits of n the segment number, so can note those bits to calculate n and limit to an arbitrary desired length or sub-section.
 As a Lindenmayer system of expansions. The simplest is two symbols F and S both straight lines, as used by the PGF code.
Axiom F, angle 90 degrees
F -> F+S
S -> F-S
This always has F at even positions and S at odd. Eg. after 3 levels F_S_F_S_F_S_F_S. The +/- turns in between bend to the left or right the same as the ""successive approximation"" method above. Read more at for instance Joel Castellanos' L-system page.

Variations are possible if you have only a single symbol for line draw, for example the Icon and Unicon and Xfractint code. The angles can also be broken into 45-degree parts to keep the expansion in a single direction rather than the endpoint rotating around.

The string rewrites can be done recursively without building the whole string, just follow its instructions at the target level. See for example C by IFS Drawing code. The effect is the same as ""recursive with parameter"" above but can draw other curves defined by L-systems.

The problem posed by Edsger Dijkstra is:

Given a number of red, blue and white balls in random order, arrange them in the order of the colours in the Dutch national flag.
When the problem was first posed, Dijkstra then went on to successively refine a solution, minimising the number of swaps and the number of times the colour of a ball needed to determined and restricting the balls to end in an array, ...

60669,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Egyptian_division,Egyptian division,"Egyptian division is a method of dividing integers using addition and
doubling that is similar to the algorithm of Ethiopian multiplication

Algorithm:

Given two numbers where the dividend is to be divided by the divisor:

 Start the construction of a table of two columns: powers_of_2, and doublings; by a first row of a 1 (i.e. 2^0) in the first column and 1 times the divisor in the first row second column.
 Create the second row with columns of 2 (i.e 2^1), and 2 * divisor in order.
 Continue with successive i’th rows of 2^i and 2^i * divisor.
 Stop adding rows, and keep only those rows, where 2^i * divisor is less than or equal to the dividend.
 We now assemble two separate sums that both start as zero, called here answer and accumulator
 Consider each row of the table, in the reverse order of its construction.
 If the current value of the accumulator added to the doublings cell would be less than or equal to the dividend then add it to the accumulator, as well as adding the powers_of_2 cell value to the answer.
 When the first row has been considered as above, then the integer division of dividend by divisor is given by answer.
 (And the remainder is given by the absolute value of accumulator - dividend).

Answer

So 580 divided by 34 using the Egyptian method is 17 remainder (578 - 580) or 2.



Task

The task is to create a function that does Egyptian division. The function should

closely follow the description above in using a list/array of powers of two, and

another of doublings.

 Functions should be clear interpretations of the algorithm.
 Use the function to divide 580 by 34 and show the answer here, on this page.

60527,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton,Elementary cellular automaton,"An elementary cellular automaton is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where there are two possible states (labeled 0 and 1) and the rule to determine the state of a cell in the next generation depends only on the current state of the cell and its two immediate neighbors. Those three values can be encoded with three bits.

The rules of evolution are then encoded with eight bits indicating the outcome of each of the eight possibilities 111, 110, 101, 100, 011, 010, 001 and 000 in this order. Thus for instance the rule 13 means that a state is updated to 1 only in the cases 011, 010 and 000, since 13 in binary is 0b00001101.



Task

Create a subroutine, program or function that allows to create and visualize the evolution of any of the 256 possible elementary cellular automaton of arbitrary space length and for any given initial state. You can demonstrate your solution with any automaton of your choice.

The space state should wrap: this means that the left-most cell should be considered as the right neighbor of the right-most cell, and reciprocally.

This task is basically a generalization of one-dimensional cellular automata.

59090,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_arithmetic,Elliptic curve arithmetic,"Elliptic curves   are sometimes used in   cryptography   as a way to perform   digital signatures.

The purpose of this task is to implement a simplified (without modular arithmetic) version of the elliptic curve arithmetic which is required by the   elliptic curve DSA   protocol.

In a nutshell, an elliptic curve is a bi-dimensional curve defined by the following relation between the x and y coordinates of any point on the curve:

   




y

2


=

x

3


+
a
x
+
b


{\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b}


a and b are arbitrary parameters that define the specific curve which is used.

For this particular task, we'll use the following parameters:

    a=0,   b=7 
The most interesting thing about elliptic curves is the fact that it is possible to define a   group   structure on it.

To do so we define an   internal composition   rule with an additive notation +,   such that for any three distinct points P, Q and R on the curve, whenever these points are aligned, we have:

    P + Q + R = 0  
Here   0   (zero)   is the infinity point,   for which the x and y values are not defined.   It's basically the same kind of point which defines the horizon in   projective geometry.

We'll also assume here that this infinity point is unique and defines the   neutral element   of the addition.

This was not the definition of the addition, but only its desired property.   For a more accurate definition, we proceed as such:

Given any three aligned points P, Q and R,   we define the sum   S = P + Q   as the point (possibly the infinity point) such that   S, R   and the infinity point are aligned.

Considering the symmetry of the curve around the x-axis, it's easy to convince oneself that two points S and R can be aligned with the infinity point if and only if S and R are symmetric of one another towards the x-axis   (because in that case there is no other candidate than the infinity point to complete the alignment triplet).

S is thus defined as the symmetric of R towards the x axis.

The task consists in defining the addition which, for any two points of the curve, returns the sum of these two points.   You will pick two random points on the curve, compute their sum and show that the symmetric of the sum is aligned with the two initial points.

You will use the a and b parameters of secp256k1, i.e. respectively zero and seven.

Hint:   You might need to define a ""doubling"" function, that returns P+P for any given point P.

Extra credit:   define the full elliptic curve arithmetic (still not modular, though) by defining a ""multiply"" function that returns,

for any point P and integer n,   the point P + P + ... + P     (n times).

60190,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Ethiopian_multiplication,Ethiopian multiplication,"Ethiopian multiplication is a method of multiplying integers using only addition, doubling, and halving.


Method:

 Take two numbers to be multiplied and write them down at the top of two columns.
 In the left-hand column repeatedly halve the last number, discarding any remainders, and write the result below the last in the same column, until you write a value of 1.
 In the right-hand column repeatedly double the last number and write the result below. stop when you add a result in the same row as where the left hand column shows 1.
 Examine the table produced and discard any row where the value in the left column is even.
 Sum the values in the right-hand column that remain to produce the result of multiplying the original two numbers together

For example:   17 × 34

       17    34

Halving the first column:

       17    34
        8
        4
        2
        1

Doubling the second column:

       17    34
        8    68
        4   136 
        2   272
        1   544

Strike-out rows whose first cell is even:

       17    34
        8    68 
        4   136 
        2   272 
        1   544

Sum the remaining numbers in the right-hand column:

       17    34
        8    -- 
        4   --- 
        2   --- 
        1   544
           ====
            578

So 17 multiplied by 34, by the Ethiopian method is 578.



Task

The task is to define three named functions/methods/procedures/subroutines:

 one to halve an integer,
 one to double an integer, and
 one to state if an integer is even.


Use these functions to create a function that does Ethiopian multiplication.

Strictly speaking, the new parent should be selected from the new pool of mutations, and then the new parent used to generate the next set of mutations with parent characters getting retained only by not being mutated. It then becomes possible that the new set of mutations has no member that is fitter than the parent!

As illustration of this error, the code for 8th has the following remark.

Create a new string based on the TOS, changing randomly any characters which
don't already match the target:

NOTE: this has been changed, the 8th version is completely random now

Clearly, this algo will be applying the mutation function only to the parent characters that don't match to the target characters!

To ensure that the new parent is never less fit than the prior parent, both the parent and all of the latest mutations are subjected to the fitness test to select the next parent.

You are encouraged to solve this task according to the task description, using any language you may know.


Task

Create an interpreter for a Markov Algorithm.

Rules have the syntax:

<ruleset> ::= ((<comment> | <rule>) <newline>+)*
<comment> ::= # {<any character>}
<rule> ::= <pattern> <whitespace> -> <whitespace> [.] <replacement>
<whitespace> ::= (<tab> | <space>) [<whitespace>]

There is one rule per line.

If there is a   .   (period)   present before the   <replacement>,   then this is a terminating rule in which case the interpreter must halt execution.

A ruleset consists of a sequence of rules, with optional comments.


 Rulesets 

Use the following tests on entries:



Ruleset 1

# This rules file is extracted from Wikipedia:
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_Algorithm
A -> apple
B -> bag
S -> shop
T -> the
the shop -> my brother
a never used -> .terminating rule

Sample text of:

  I bought a B of As from T S. 
Should generate the output:

  I bought a bag of apples from my brother. 


Ruleset 2

A test of the terminating rule

# Slightly modified from the rules on Wikipedia
A -> apple
B -> bag
S -> .shop
T -> the
the shop -> my brother
a never used -> .terminating rule
Sample text of:

 I bought a B of As from T S.
Should generate:

 I bought a bag of apples from T shop.


Ruleset 3

This tests for correct substitution order and may trap simple regexp based replacement routines if special regexp characters are not escaped.

# BNF Syntax testing rules
A -> apple
WWWW -> with
Bgage -> ->.*
B -> bag
->.* -> money
W -> WW
S -> .shop
T -> the
the shop -> my brother
a never used -> .terminating rule

Sample text of:

 I bought a B of As W my Bgage from T S.
Should generate:

 I bought a bag of apples with my money from T shop.


Ruleset 4

This tests for correct order of scanning of rules, and may trap replacement routines that scan in the wrong order.   It implements a general unary multiplication engine.   (Note that the input expression must be placed within underscores in this implementation.)

Ruleset 5

A simple Turing machine,
implementing a three-state busy beaver.

The tape consists of 0s and 1s,   the states are A, B, C and H (for Halt), and the head position is indicated by writing the state letter before the character where the head is.
All parts of the initial tape the machine operates on have to be given in the input.

Besides demonstrating that the Markov algorithm is Turing-complete, it also made me catch a bug in the C++ implementation which wasn't caught by the first four rulesets.

# Turing machine: three-state busy beaver

# state A, symbol 0 => write 1, move right, new state B
A0 -> 1B

These are examples of control structures. You may also be interested in:

 Conditional structures
 Exceptions
 Flow-control structures
 Loops

Some programming languages allow you to extend the language. While this can be done to a certain degree in most languages (e.g. by using macros), other languages go much further. Most notably in the Forth and Lisp families, programming per se is done by extending the language without any formal distinction between built-in and user-defined elements.

If your language supports it, show how to introduce a new flow control mechanism. A practical and useful example is a four-way branch:

Occasionally, code must be written that depends on two conditions, resulting in up to four branches (depending on whether both, only the first, only the second, or none of the conditions are ""true""). In a C-like language this could look like the following:

  if (condition1isTrue) {
     if (condition2isTrue)
        bothConditionsAreTrue();
     else
        firstConditionIsTrue();
  }
  else if (condition2isTrue)
     secondConditionIsTrue();
  else
     noConditionIsTrue();

Besides being rather cluttered, the statement(s) for 'condition2isTrue' must be written down twice. If 'condition2isTrue' were a lengthy and involved expression, it would be quite unreadable, and the code generated by the compiler might be unnecessarily large.

This can be improved by introducing a new keyword if2. It is similar to if, but takes two conditional statements instead of one, and up to three 'else' statements. One proposal (in pseudo-C syntax) might be:

  if2 (condition1isTrue) (condition2isTrue)
     bothConditionsAreTrue();
  else1
     firstConditionIsTrue();
  else2
     secondConditionIsTrue();
  else
     noConditionIsTrue();

Pick the syntax which suits your language. The keywords 'else1' and 'else2' are just examples. The new conditional expression should look, nest and behave analogously to the language's built-in 'if' statement.

Write a generator of prime numbers, in order, that will automatically adjust to accommodate the generation of any reasonably high prime.

The routine should demonstrably rely on either:

 Being based on an open-ended counter set to count without upper limit other than system or programming language limits. In this case, explain where this counter is in the code.
 Being based on a limit that is extended automatically. In this case, choose a small limit that ensures the limit will be passed when generating some of the values to be asked for below.
 If other methods of creating an extensible prime generator are used, the algorithm's means of extensibility/lack of limits should be stated.


The routine should be used to:

 Show the first twenty primes.
 Show the primes between 100 and 150.
 Show the number of primes between 7,700 and 8,000.
 Show the 10,000th prime.

Calculate the   FFT   (Fast Fourier Transform)   of an input sequence.

The most general case allows for complex numbers at the input
and results in a sequence of equal length, again of complex numbers.
If you need to restrict yourself to real numbers, the output should
be the magnitude   (i.e.:   sqrt(re2 + im2))   of the complex result.

The classic version is the recursive Cooley–Tukey FFT. Wikipedia has pseudo-code for that.
Further optimizations are possible but not required.

The largest such prime in a given (integer) base is therefore computable, provided the base is larger than 2.

Let's consider what happens in base 10. Obviously the right most digit must be prime, so in base 10 candidates are 2,3,5,7. Putting a digit in the range 1 to base-1 in front of each candidate must result in a prime. So 2 and 5, like the whale and the petunias in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, come into existence only to be extinguished before they have time to realize it, because 2 and 5 preceded by any digit in the range 1 to base-1 is not prime. Some numbers formed by preceding 3 or 7 by a digit in the range 1 to base-1 are prime. So 13,17,23,37,43,47,53,67,73,83,97 are candidates. Again, putting a digit in the range 1 to base-1 in front of each candidate must be a prime. Repeating until there are no larger candidates finds the largest left truncatable prime.

Let's work base 3 by hand:

0 and 1 are not prime so the last digit must be 2. 123 = 510 which is prime, 223 = 810 which is not so 123 is the only candidate. 1123 = 1410 which is not prime, 2123 = 2310 which is, so 2123 is the only candidate. 12123 = 5010 which is not prime, 22123 = 7710 which also is not prime. So there are no more candidates, therefore 23 is the largest left truncatable prime in base 3.

The task is to reconstruct as much, and possibly more, of the table in the OEIS as you are able.

""Simulate"" a four-bit adder.

This design can be realized using four 1-bit full adders.
Each of these 1-bit full adders can be built with two half adders and an   or   gate. ;

Finally a half adder can be made using an   xor   gate and an   and   gate.

The   xor   gate can be made using two   nots,   two   ands   and one   or.

Not,   or   and   and,   the only allowed ""gates"" for the task, can be ""imitated"" by using the bitwise operators of your language.

If there is not a bit type in your language, to be sure that the   not   does not ""invert"" all the other bits of the basic type   (e.g. a byte)   we are not interested in,   you can use an extra   nand   (and   then   not)   with the constant   1   on one input.

Instead of optimizing and reducing the number of gates used for the final 4-bit adder,   build it in the most straightforward way,   connecting the other ""constructive blocks"",   in turn made of ""simpler"" and ""smaller"" ones.


Schematics of the ""constructive blocks""

Solutions should try to be as descriptive as possible, making it as easy as possible to identify ""connections"" between higher-order ""blocks"".

It is not mandatory to replicate the syntax of higher-order blocks in the atomic ""gate"" blocks, i.e. basic ""gate"" operations can be performed as usual bitwise operations, or they can be ""wrapped"" in a block in order to expose the same syntax of higher-order blocks, at implementers' choice.

To test the implementation, show the sum of two four-bit numbers (in binary).

53258,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Four_is_magic,Four is magic,"Task

Write a subroutine, function, whatever it may be called in your language, that takes an integer number and returns an English text sequence starting with the English cardinal representation of that integer, the word 'is' and then the English cardinal representation of the count of characters that made up the first word, followed by a comma.

Continue the sequence by using the previous count word as the first word of the next phrase, append 'is' and the cardinal count of the letters in that word.

Continue until you reach four. Since four has four characters, finish by adding the words 'four is magic' and a period. All integers will eventually wind up at four.

For instance, suppose your are given the integer 3. Convert 3 to Three, add  is , then the cardinal character count of three, or five, with a comma to separate if from the next phrase. Continue the sequence five is four, (five has four letters), and finally, four is magic.

     Three is five, five is four, four is magic.

For reference, here are outputs for 0 through 9.

     Zero is four, four is magic.
     One is three, three is five, five is four, four is magic.
     Two is three, three is five, five is four, four is magic.
     Three is five, five is four, four is magic.
     Four is magic.
     Five is four, four is magic.
     Six is three, three is five, five is four, four is magic.
     Seven is five, five is four, four is magic.
     Eight is five, five is four, four is magic.
     Nine is four, four is magic.



Some task guidelines

 You may assume the input will only contain integer numbers.
 Cardinal numbers between 20 and 100 may use either hyphens or spaces as word separators but they must use a word separator. (23 is twenty three or twenty-three not twentythree.)
 Cardinal number conversions should follow the  English short scale. (billion is 1e9, trillion is 1e12, etc.)
 Cardinal numbers should not include commas. (20140 is twenty thousand one hundred forty not twenty thousand, one hundred forty.)
 When converted to a string, 100 should be one hundred, not a hundred or hundred, 1000 should be one thousand, not a thousand or thousand.
 When converted to a string, there should be no and in the cardinal string. 130 should be one hundred thirty not one hundred and thirty.
 When counting characters, count all of the characters in the cardinal number including spaces and hyphens. One hundred fifty-one should be 21 not 18.
 The output should follow the format ""N is K, K is M, M is ... four is magic."" (unless the input is 4, in which case the output should simply be ""four is magic."")
 The output can either be the return value from the function, or be displayed from within the function.
 You are encouraged, though not mandated to use proper sentence capitalization.
 You may optionally support negative numbers. -7 is negative seven.
 Show the output here for a small representative sample of values, at least 5 but no more than 25. You are free to choose which which numbers to use for output demonstration.


You can choose to use a library, (module, external routine, whatever) to do the cardinal conversions as long as the code is easily and freely available to the public.

If you roll your own, make the routine accept at minimum any integer from 0 up to 999999. If you use a pre-made library, support at least up to unsigned 64 bit integers. (or the largest integer supported in your language if it is less.)

Four is magic is a popular code-golf task. This is not code golf. Write legible, idiomatic and well formatted code.

Task

Write a program that reads a list of fractions in a natural format from the keyboard or from a string,
to parse it into a sequence of fractions (i.e. two integers),
and runs the FRACTRAN starting from a provided integer, writing the result at each step.
It is also required that the number of steps is limited (by a parameter easy to find).



Extra credit

Use this program to derive the first 20 or so prime numbers.

Definitions

The   fusc   integer sequence is defined as:

   fusc(0) = 0
   fusc(1) = 1
   for n>1,   the   nth   term is defined as:
   if   n   is even;     fusc(n) = fusc(n/2)
   if   n   is   odd;     fusc(n) = fusc((n-1)/2)   +   fusc((n+1)/2)


Note that MathWorld's definition starts with unity, not zero.   This task will be using the OEIS' version   (above).



An observation

   fusc(A) = fusc(B)
where   A   is some non-negative integer expressed in binary,   and
where   B   is the binary value of   A   reversed.



Fusc numbers are also known as:

   fusc function   (named by Dijkstra, 1982)
   Stern's Diatomic series   (although it starts with unity, not zero)
   Stern-Brocot sequence   (although it starts with unity, not zero)


Task

   show the first   61   fusc numbers (starting at zero) in a horizontal format.
   show the fusc number (and its index) whose length is greater than any previous fusc number length.
   (the length is the number of decimal digits when the fusc number is expressed in base ten.)
   show all numbers with commas   (if appropriate).
   show all output here.

A   Galton device   Sir Francis Galton's device   is also known as a   bean machine,   a   Galton Board,   or a   quincunx.



Description of operation

In a Galton box, there are a set of pins arranged in a triangular pattern.   A number of balls are dropped so that they fall in line with the top pin, deflecting to the left or the right of the pin.   The ball continues to fall to the left or right of lower pins before arriving at one of the collection points between and to the sides of the bottom row of pins.

Eventually the balls are collected into bins at the bottom   (as shown in the image),   the ball column heights in the bins approximate a   bell curve.   Overlaying   Pascal's triangle   onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each bin.



Task

Generate an animated simulation of a Galton device.



Task requirements

   The box should have at least 5 pins on the bottom row. 
   A solution can use graphics or ASCII animation. 
   Provide a sample of the output/display such as a screenshot.
   There can be one or more balls in flight at the same time. 
   If multiple balls are in flight, ensure they don't interfere with each other.
   A solution should allow users to specify the number of balls, or it should run until full or a preset limit. 
   Optionally,   display the number of balls.

Write a generalized version of FizzBuzz that works for any list of factors, along with their words.

This is basically a ""fizzbuzz"" implementation where the user supplies the parameters.

The user will enter the max number, then they will enter the factors to be calculated along with the corresponding word to be printed.

For simplicity's sake, assume the user will input an integer as the max number and 3 factors, each with a word associated with them.



For example, given:

>20      #This is the maximum number, supplied by the user
>3 Fizz  #The user now enters the starting factor (3) and the word they want associated with it (Fizz)
>5 Buzz  #The user now enters the next factor (5) and the word they want associated with it (Buzz)
>7 Baxx  #The user now enters the next factor (7) and the word they want associated with it (Baxx)

In other words: For this example, print the numbers 1 through 20, replacing every multiple of 3 with ""Fizz"", every multiple of 5 with ""Buzz"", and every multiple of 7 with ""Baxx"".

In the case where a number is a multiple of at least two factors, print each of the words associated with those factors in the order of least to greatest factor.

For instance, the number 15 is a multiple of both 3 and 5; print ""FizzBuzz"".

If the max number was 105 instead of 20, you would print ""FizzBuzzBaxx"" because it's a multiple of 3, 5, and 7.

Generate a random chess position in FEN format.

The position does not have to be realistic or even balanced,  but it must comply to the following rules:

 there is one and only one king of each color  (one black king and one white king);
 the kings must not be placed on adjacent squares;
 there can not be any pawn in the promotion square  (no white pawn in the eighth rank, and no black pawn in the first rank);
 including the kings, up to 32 pieces of either color can be placed. 
 There is no requirement for material balance between sides. 
 The picking of pieces does not have to comply to a regular chess set --- there can be five knights, twenty rooks, whatever ... as long as the total number of pieces do not exceed thirty-two. 
 it is white's turn.
 It's assumed that both sides have lost castling rights and that there is no possibility for   en passant   (the FEN should thus end in w - - 0 1).


No requirement is made regarding the probability distribution of your method, but your program should be able to span a reasonably representative sample of all possible positions. For instance, programs that would always generate positions with say five pieces on the board, or with kings on a corner, would not be considered truly random.

48644,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hash_join,Hash join,"An inner join is an operation that combines two data tables into one table, based on matching column values. The simplest way of implementing this operation is the nested loop join algorithm, but a more scalable alternative is the hash join algorithm.

Task[edit]
Implement the ""hash join"" algorithm, and demonstrate that it passes the test-case listed below.

You should represent the tables as data structures that feel natural in your programming language.

Guidance
The ""hash join"" algorithm consists of two steps:

 Hash phase: Create a multimap from one of the two tables, mapping from each join column value to all the rows that contain it.

 The multimap must support hash-based lookup which scales better than a simple linear search, because that's the whole point of this algorithm.
 Ideally we should create the multimap for the smaller table, thus minimizing its creation time and memory size.
 Join phase: Scan the other table, and find matching rows by looking in the multimap created before.


In pseudo-code, the algorithm could be expressed as follows:

let A = the first input table (or ideally, the larger one)
let B = the second input table (or ideally, the smaller one)
let jA = the join column ID of table A
let jB = the join column ID of table B
let MB = a multimap for mapping from single values to multiple rows of table B (starts out empty)
let C = the output table (starts out empty)

for each row b in table B:
   place b in multimap MB under key b(jB)

for each row a in table A:
   for each row b in multimap MB under key a(jA):
      let c = the concatenation of row a and row b
      place row c in table C

   Starting with the list [1,1],
   Take the last number in the list so far: 1, I'll call it x.
   Count forward x places from the beginning of the list to find the first number to add (1)
   Count backward x places from the end of the list to find the second number to add (1)
   Add the two indexed numbers from the list and the result becomes the next number in the list (1+1)
   This would then produce [1,1,2] where 2 is the third element of the sequence.

Note that indexing for the description above starts from alternately the left and right ends of the list and starts from an index of one.

A less wordy description of the sequence is:

   a(1)=a(2)=1
   a(n)=a(a(n-1))+a(n-a(n-1))

The sequence begins:

   1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, ...

Interesting features of the sequence are that:

   a(n)/n   tends to   0.5   as   n   grows towards infinity.
   a(n)/n   where   n   is a power of   2   is   0.5
   For   n>4   the maximal value of   a(n)/n   between successive powers of 2 decreases.



The sequence is so named because John Conway offered a prize of $10,000 to the first person who could
find the first position,   p   in the sequence where

   │a(n)/n│ < 0.55  for all  n > p

It was later found that Hofstadter had also done prior work on the sequence.

The 'prize' was won quite quickly by Dr. Colin L. Mallows who proved the properties of the sequence and allowed him to find the value of   n   (which is much smaller than the 3,173,375,556 quoted in the NYT article).

Create a program that calculates the hour, sun hour angle, dial hour line angle from 6am to 6pm for an operator entered location.



For example, the user is prompted for a location and inputs the latitude and longitude 4°57′S 150°30′W (4.95°S 150.5°W of Jules Verne's Lincoln Island, aka Ernest Legouve Reef), with a legal meridian of 150°W.

(Note: the ""meridian"" is approximately the same concept as the ""longitude"" - the distinction is that the meridian is used to determine when it is ""noon"" for official purposes. This will typically be slightly different from when the sun appears at its highest location, because of the structure of time zones. For most, but not all, time zones (hour wide zones with hour zero centred on Greenwich), the legal meridian will be an even multiple of 15 degrees.)

Wikipedia: A sundial is a device that measures time by the position of the Sun. In common designs such as the horizontal sundial, the sun casts a shadow from its style (also called its Gnomon, a thin rod or a sharp, straight edge) onto a flat surface marked with lines indicating the hours of the day (also called the dial face or dial plate). As the sun moves across the sky, the shadow-edge progressively aligns with different hour-lines on the plate. Such designs rely on the style being aligned with the axis of the Earth's rotation. Hence, if such a sundial is to tell the correct time, the style must point towards true north (not the north or south magnetic pole) and the style's angle with horizontal must equal the sundial's geographical latitude.

The idea is that where there is a straight line in the original image, it corresponds to a bright (or dark, depending on the color of the background field) spot; by applying a suitable filter to the results of the transform, it is possible to extract the locations of the lines in the original image.

46061,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/I_before_E_except_after_C,I before E except after C,"The phrase      ""I before E, except after C""     is a
widely known mnemonic which is supposed to help when spelling English words.



Task

Using the word list from   http://wiki.puzzlers.org/pub/wordlists/unixdict.txt,

check if the two sub-clauses of the phrase are plausible individually:

   ""I before E when not preceded by C""
   ""E before I when preceded by C""


If both sub-phrases are plausible then the original phrase can be said to be plausible.

Something is plausible if the number of words having the feature is more than two times the number of words having the opposite feature (where feature is 'ie' or 'ei' preceded or not by 'c' as appropriate).



Stretch goal

As a stretch goal use the entries from the table of Word Frequencies in Written and Spoken English: based on the British National Corpus, (selecting those rows with three space or tab separated words only), to see if the phrase is plausible when word frequencies are taken into account.

45393,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Inheritance/Single,Inheritance/Single," This task is about derived types;   for implementation inheritance, see Polymorphism.


Inheritance is an operation of type algebra that creates a new type from one or several parent types.

The obtained type is called derived type.

It inherits some of the properties of its parent types.

Usually inherited properties are:

   methods
   components
   parts of the representation


The  class of the new type is a   subclass   of the classes rooted in the parent types.

When all (in certain sense) properties of the parents are preserved by the derived type,   it is said to be a Liskov subtype.

When properties are preserved then the derived type is substitutable for its parents in all contexts.   Usually full substitutability is achievable only in some contexts.



Inheritance is

   single, when only one parent is allowed
    multiple, otherwise


Some single inheritance languages usually allow multiple inheritance for certain abstract types, interfaces in particular.

Inheritance can be considered as a relation parent-child.

Parent types are sometimes called supertype, the derived ones are subtype.   This relation is transitive and reflexive.

Types bound by the relation form a wp:Directed_acyclic_graph directed acyclic graph (ignoring reflexivity).

With single inheritance it becomes a tree.



Task

Show a tree of types which inherit from each other.

   At the top of the tree should be a class called   Animal. 
   The second level should have Dog and Cat. 
   Under   Dog   should be   Lab   and   Collie. 
   None of the classes need to have any functions,   the only thing they need to do is inherit from the specified superclasses 
   (overriding functions should be shown in Polymorphism). 


The tree should look like this:

                        Animal
                          /\
                         /  \

Task
Problem: you have a standard 8x8 chessboard, empty but for a single knight on some square. Your task is to emit a series of legal knight moves that result in the knight visiting every square on the chessboard exactly once. Note that it is not a requirement that the tour be ""closed""; that is, the knight need not end within a single move of its start position.

Input and output may be textual or graphical, according to the conventions of the programming environment. If textual, squares should be indicated in algebraic notation. The output should indicate the order in which the knight visits the squares, starting with the initial position. The form of the output may be a diagram of the board with the squares numbered according to visitation sequence, or a textual list of algebraic coordinates in order, or even an actual animation of the knight moving around the chessboard.

Input: starting square

Output: move sequence

 the maximum sample size, returns a function s_of_n that takes one parameter, item.
 Function s_of_n when called with successive items returns an equi-weighted random sample of up to n of its items so far, each time it is called, calculated using Knuths Algorithm S.
 Test your functions by printing and showing the frequency of occurrences of the selected digits from 100,000 repetitions of:
 Use the s_of_n_creator with n == 3 to generate an s_of_n.
 call s_of_n with each of the digits 0 to 9 in order, keeping the returned three digits of its random sampling from its last call with argument item=9.


Note: A class taking n and generating a callable instance/function might also be used.

Where, for the power   43,   following the tree ""downwards"" from   1:

   (for   2)   compute square of   X,   store X2
   (for   3)   compute   X * X2,   store X3
   (for   5)   compute   X3 * X2,   store X5
   (for 10)   compute square of   X5,   store X10
   (for 20)   compute square of   X10,   store X20
   (for 40)   compute square of   X20,   store X40
   (for 43)   compute   X40 * X3   (result).
Note that for every even integer (in the power tree),   one just squares the previous value.

For an odd integer, multiply the previous value with an appropriate odd power of   X   (which was previously calculated).
  For the last multiplication in the above example, it would be   (43-40),   or   3. 


According to Dr. Knuth (see below),   computer tests have shown that this power tree gives optimum results for all of the   n
  listed above in the graph.

For   n   ≤ 100,000,   the power tree method:

   bests the factor method   88,803   times,
   ties   11,191   times,
   loses   6   times.

It is a modified form of Gaussian elimination.
While the Cholesky decomposition only works for symmetric,
positive definite matrices, the more general LU decomposition
works for any square matrix.

There are several algorithms for calculating L and U.
To derive Crout's algorithm for a 3x3 example,
we have to solve the following system:

We now would have to solve 9 equations with 12 unknowns. To make the system uniquely solvable, usually the diagonal elements of

We see in the second formula that to get the 




l

i
j




{\displaystyle l_{ij}}

 below the diagonal, we have to divide by the diagonal element (pivot) 




u

j
j




{\displaystyle u_{jj}}

, so we get problems when 




u

j
j




{\displaystyle u_{jj}}

 is either 0 or very small, which leads to numerical instability.

The solution to this problem is pivoting 



A


{\displaystyle A}

, which means rearranging the rows of 



A


{\displaystyle A}

, prior to the 



L
U


{\displaystyle LU}

 decomposition, in a way that the largest element of each column gets onto the diagonal of 



A


{\displaystyle A}

. Rearranging the rows means to multiply 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 by a permutation matrix 



P


{\displaystyle P}

:





P
A
⇒

A
′



{\displaystyle PA\Rightarrow A'}


Example:







(



0


1




1


0



)




(



1


4




2


3



)


⇒


(



2


3




1


4



)




{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}1&4\\2&3\end{pmatrix}}\Rightarrow {\begin{pmatrix}2&3\\1&4\end{pmatrix}}}


The decomposition algorithm is then applied on the rearranged matrix so that





P
A
=
L
U


{\displaystyle PA=LU}




Task description

The task is to implement a routine which will take a square nxn matrix 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 and return a lower triangular matrix 



L


{\displaystyle L}

, a upper triangular matrix 



U


{\displaystyle U}

 and a permutation matrix 



P

so that the above equation is fulfilled.

42551,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant,Langton's ant,"Langton's ant is a cellular automaton that models an ant sitting on a plane of cells, all of which are white initially, the ant facing in one of four directions.

Each cell can either be black or white.

The ant moves according to the color of the cell it is currently sitting in, with the following rules:

   If the cell is black, it changes to white and the ant turns left;
   If the cell is white, it changes to black and the ant turns right;
   The ant then moves forward to the next cell, and repeat from step 1.

This rather simple ruleset leads to an initially chaotic movement pattern, and after about 10000 steps, a cycle appears where the ant moves steadily away from the starting location in a diagonal corridor about 10 cells wide.
Conceptually the ant can then walk infinitely far away.



Task

Start the ant near the center of a 100x100 field of cells, which is about big enough to contain the initial chaotic part of the movement.

Follow the movement rules for the ant, terminate when it moves out of the region, and show the cell colors it leaves behind.



The problem has received some analysis; for more details, please take a look at the Wikipedia article   (a link is below)..

Given a set of positive integers, write a function to order the integers in such a way that the concatenation of the numbers forms the largest possible integer and return this integer.

Use the following two sets of integers as tests   and   show your program output here.

   {1, 34, 3, 98, 9, 76, 45, 4}
   {54, 546, 548, 60}


Possible algorithms

 A solution could be found by trying all combinations and return the best. 
 Another way to solve this is to note that in the best arrangement, for any two adjacent original integers X and Y, the concatenation X followed by Y will be numerically greater than or equal to the concatenation Y followed by X.
 Yet another way to solve this is to pad the integers to the same size by repeating the digits then sort using these repeated integers as a sort key.

Find the largest base 10 integer whose digits are all different,   and   is evenly divisible by each of its individual digits.



These numbers are also known as   Lynch-Bell numbers,   numbers   n   such that the
(base ten) digits are all different (and do not include zero)   and   n   is divisible by each of its individual digits.



Example

135   is evenly divisible by   1,   3,   and   5.



Note that the digit zero (0) can not be in the number as integer division by zero is undefined.

The digits must all be unique so a base ten number will have at most 9 digits.

Feel free to use analytics and clever algorithms to reduce the search space your example needs to visit, but it must do an actual search. (Don't just feed it the answer and verify it is correct.)

 This page uses content from Wikipedia. The original article was at Levenshtein distance. The list of authors can be seen in the page history. As with Rosetta Code, the text of Wikipedia is available under the GNU FDL. (See links for details on variance)



In information theory and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a metric for measuring the amount of difference between two sequences (i.e. an edit distance). The Levenshtein distance between two strings is defined as the minimum number of edits needed to transform one string into the other, with the allowable edit operations being insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character.



Example

The Levenshtein distance between ""kitten"" and ""sitting"" is 3, since the following three edits change one into the other, and there isn't a way to do it with fewer than three edits:

   kitten   sitten   (substitution of 'k' with 's')
   sitten   sittin   (substitution of 'e' with 'i')
   sittin   sitting   (insert 'g' at the end).

The Levenshtein distance between   ""rosettacode"",   ""raisethysword""   is   8.

The distance between two strings is same as that when both strings are reversed.



Task

Implements a Levenshtein distance function, or uses a library function, to show the Levenshtein distance between   ""kitten""   and   ""sitting"".

An alignment is a notation used to describe the operations used to turn a string into an other. At some point in the strings, the minus character ('-') is placed in order to signify that a character must be added at this very place. For instance, an alignment between the words 'place' and 'palace' is:

P-LACE
PALACE



Task

Write a function that shows the alignment of two strings for the corresponding levenshtein distance.

As an example, use the words ""rosettacode"" and ""raisethysword"".

The task is to replicate two historic random number generators. One is the rand() function from BSD libc, and the other is the rand() function from the Microsoft C Runtime (MSCVRT.DLL). Each replica must yield the same sequence of integers as the original generator, when starting from the same seed.

If we use a matching pair of parentheses to represent a bag, the ways are:

For 1 bag, there's one way:

 ()	<- a bag

for 2 bags, there's one way:

 (())	<- one bag in another

for 3 bags, there are two:

 ((())) <- 3 bags nested Russian doll style
 (()()) <- 2 bags side by side, inside the third

for 4 bags, four:

 (()()())
 ((())())
 ((()()))
 (((())))

Note that because all bags are identical, the two 4-bag strings ((())()) and (()(())) represent the same configuration.

It's easy to see that each configuration for n bags represents a n-node rooted tree, where a bag is a tree node, and a bag with its content forms a subtree. The outermost bag is the tree root. Number of configurations for given n is given by OEIS A81.



Task
 
Write a program that, when given n, enumerates all ways of nesting n bags.   You can use the parentheses notation above, or any tree representation that's unambiguous and preferably intuitive.

This task asks for enumeration of trees only; for counting solutions without enumeration, that OEIS page lists various formulas, but that's not encouraged by this task, especially if implementing it would significantly increase code size.

As an example output, run 5 bags.   There should be 9 ways.

A   long prime   (as defined here)   is a prime number whose reciprocal   (in decimal)   has
a   period length   of one less than the prime number.


Long primes   are also known as:

   base ten cyclic numbers
   full reptend primes
   golden primes
   long period primes
   maximal period primes
   proper primes


Another definition:   primes   p   such that the decimal expansion of   1/p   has period   p-1,   which is the greatest period possible for any integer.



Example

7   is the first long prime,   the reciprocal of seven
is   1/7,   which
is equal to the repeating decimal fraction   0.142857142857···

The length of the   repeating   part of the decimal fraction
is six,   (the underlined part)   which is one less
than the (decimal) prime number   7.

Thus   7   is a long prime.



There are other (more) general definitions of a   long prime   which
include wording/verbiage for bases other than ten.



Task

Write a function that returns the longest common substring of two strings.

Use it within a program that demonstrates sample output from the function, which will consist of the longest common substring between ""thisisatest"" and ""testing123testing"".

Note that substrings are consecutive characters within a string.   This distinguishes them from subsequences, which is any sequence of characters within a string, even if there are extraneous characters in between them.

Hence, the longest common subsequence between ""thisisatest"" and ""testing123testing"" is ""tsitest"", whereas the longest common substring is just ""test"".

39334,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Longest_string_challenge,Longest string challenge,"Background

This ""longest string challenge"" is inspired by a problem that used to be given to students learning Icon. Students were expected to try to solve the problem in Icon and another language with which the student was already familiar. The basic problem is quite simple; the challenge and fun part came through the introduction of restrictions. Experience has shown that the original restrictions required some adjustment to bring out the intent of the challenge and make it suitable for Rosetta Code.



Basic problem statement
Write a program that reads lines from standard input and, upon end of file, writes the longest line to standard output.
If there are ties for the longest line, the program writes out all the lines that tie.
If there is no input, the program should produce no output.



Task 
Implement a solution to the basic problem that adheres to the spirit of the restrictions (see below).

Describe how you circumvented or got around these 'restrictions' and met the 'spirit' of the challenge. Your supporting description may need to describe any challenges to interpreting the restrictions and how you made this interpretation. You should state any assumptions, warnings, or other relevant points. The central idea here is to make the task a bit more interesting by thinking outside of the box and perhaps by showing off the capabilities of your language in a creative way. Because there is potential for considerable variation between solutions, the description is key to helping others see what you've done.

This task is likely to encourage a variety of different types of solutions. They should be substantially different approaches.

Given the input:

a
bb
ccc
ddd
ee
f
ggg

the output should be (possibly rearranged):

ccc
ddd
ggg



Original list of restrictions
 No comparison operators may be used.
 No arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, may be used.
 The only datatypes you may use are integer and string. In particular, you may not use lists.
 Do not re-read the input file. Avoid using files as a replacement for lists (this restriction became apparent in the discussion).


Intent of restrictions

Because of the variety of languages on Rosetta Code and the wide variety of concepts used in them, there needs to be a bit of clarification and guidance here to get to the spirit of the challenge and the intent of the restrictions.

The basic problem can be solved very conventionally, but that's boring and pedestrian. The original intent here wasn't to unduly frustrate people with interpreting the restrictions, it was to get people to think outside of their particular box and have a bit of fun doing it.

The guiding principle here should be to be creative in demonstrating some of the capabilities of the programming language being used. If you need to bend the restrictions a bit, explain why and try to follow the intent. If you think you've implemented a 'cheat', call out the fragment yourself and ask readers if they can spot why. If you absolutely can't get around one of the restrictions, explain why in your description.

Now having said that, the restrictions require some elaboration.

 In general, the restrictions are meant to avoid the explicit use of these features.
 ""No comparison operators may be used"" - At some level there must be some test that allows the solution to get at the length and determine if one string is longer. Comparison operators, in particular any less/greater comparison should be avoided. Representing the length of any string as a number should also be avoided. Various approaches allow for detecting the end of a string. Some of these involve implicitly using equal/not-equal; however, explicitly using equal/not-equal should be acceptable.
 ""No arithmetic operations"" - Again, at some level something may have to advance through the string. Often there are ways a language can do this implicitly advance a cursor or pointer without explicitly using a +, - , ++, --, add, subtract, etc.
 The datatype restrictions are amongst the most difficult to reinterpret. In the language of the original challenge strings are atomic datatypes and structured datatypes like lists are quite distinct and have many different operations that apply to them. This becomes a bit fuzzier with languages with a different programming paradigm. The intent would be to avoid using an easy structure to accumulate the longest strings and spit them out. There will be some natural reinterpretation here.


To make this a bit more concrete, here are a couple of specific examples:
In C, a string is an array of chars, so using a couple of arrays as strings is in the spirit while using a second array in a non-string like fashion would violate the intent.
In APL or J, arrays are the core of the language so ruling them out is unfair. Meeting the spirit will come down to how they are used.

Please keep in mind these are just examples and you may hit new territory finding a solution. There will be other cases like these. Explain your reasoning. You may want to open a discussion on the talk page as well.

 The added ""No rereading"" restriction is for practical reasons, re-reading stdin should be broken. I haven't outright banned the use of other files but I've discouraged them as it is basically another form of a list. Somewhere there may be a language that just sings when doing file manipulation and where that makes sense; however, for most there should be a way to accomplish without resorting to an externality.


At the end of the day for the implementer this should be a bit of fun. As an implementer you represent the expertise in your language, the reader may have no knowledge of your language. For the reader it should give them insight into how people think outside the box in other languages. Comments, especially for non-obvious (to the reader) bits will be extremely helpful. While the implementations may be a bit artificial in the context of this task, the general techniques may be useful elsewhere.

its   iterator   (the index
variable)   is modified within the

Goal

Demonstrate the best way to accomplish this.



Task

Write a loop which:

   starts the index (variable) at   42
   (at iteration time)   increments the index by unity
   if the index is prime:
   displays the count of primes found (so far) and the prime   (to the terminal)
   increments the index such that the new index is now the (old) index plus that prime
   terminates the loop when   42   primes are shown


Extra credit:   because of the primes get rather large, use commas
within the displayed primes to ease comprehension.



Show all output here.



Note

Not all programming languages allow the modification of a
loop's index.   If that is the case, then use whatever method that
is appropriate or idiomatic for that language.   Please add a note
if the loop's index isn't modifiable.

Task

Simulate/translate the above PL/I program snippet as best as possible in your
language,   with particular emphasis on the   do   loop construct.

The   do   index must be incremented/decremented in the same order shown.

If feasible, add commas to the two output numbers (being displayed).

Show all output here.

      A simple PL/I   DO  loop  (incrementing or decrementing)  has the construct of:
 
            DO variable = start_expression    {TO ending_expression]       {BY increment_expression} ;
                 ---or---
            DO variable = start_expression    {BY increment_expression}    {TO ending_expression]    ;  
 
      where it is understood that all expressions will have a value.  The  variable  is normally a 
      scaler variable,  but need not be  (but for this task, all variables and expressions are declared
      to be scaler integers).   If the   BY   expression is omitted,  a   BY   value of unity is used.
      All expressions are evaluated before the   DO   loop is executed,  and those values are used
      throughout the   DO   loop execution   (even though, for instance,  the value of   Z   may be
      changed within the   DO   loop.    This isn't the case here for this task.  
 
      A multiple-range   DO   loop can be constructed by using a comma (,) to separate additional ranges
      (the use of multiple   TO   and/or   BY   keywords).     This is the construct used in this task.
 
      There are other forms of   DO   loops in PL/I involving the  WHILE  clause,  but those won't be 
      needed here.    DO  loops without a   TO   clause might need a   WHILE   clause  or some other 
      means of exiting the loop  (such as  LEAVE,  RETURN,  SIGNAL,  GOTO,  or  STOP),  or some other 
      (possible error) condition that causes transfer of control outside the  DO  loop.
 
      Also, in PL/I, the check if the   DO   loop index value is outside the range is made at the 
      ""head""  (start)  of the   DO  loop,  so it's possible that the   DO   loop isn't executed,  but 
      that isn't the case for any of the ranges used in this task. 
 
      In the example above, the clause:                    x    to y       by z     
      will cause the variable   J   to have to following values  (in this order):  5  3  1  -1  -3  -5
 
      In the example above, the clause:                 -seven  to +seven  by x  
      will cause the variable   J   to have to following values  (in this order):  -7  -2   3

Some languages have syntax or function(s) to generate a range of numeric values from a start value, a stop value, and an increment.

The purpose of this task is to select the range syntax/function that would generate at least two increasing numbers when given a stop value more than the start value and a positive increment of less than half the difference.   You are then to use that same syntax/function but with different parameters; and show, here, what would happen.

Use these values if possible:

Task requirements
 Write one or two subroutines (functions) to generate lucky numbers and even lucky numbers 
 Write a command-line interface to allow selection of which kind of numbers and which number(s). Since input is from the command line, tests should be made for the common errors:
 missing arguments
 too many arguments
 number (or numbers) aren't legal
 misspelled argument (lucky or evenLucky)
 The command line handling should:
 support mixed case handling of the (non-numeric) arguments
 support printing a particular number
 support printing a range of numbers by their index
 support printing a range of numbers by their values
 The resulting list of numbers should be printed on a single line.

The program should support the arguments:

                             what is displayed  (on a single line)
       argument(s)              (optional verbiage is encouraged)

37402,http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Lychrel_numbers,Lychrel numbers,"   Take an integer n, greater than zero.
   Form the next n of its series by reversing the digits of the current n and adding the result to the current n.
   Stop when n becomes palindromic - i.e. the digits of n in reverse order == n.


The above recurrence relation when applied to most starting numbers n = 1, 2, ... terminates in a palindrome quite quickly.



Example

If n0 = 12 we get

       12
       12 +  21 =  33,   a palindrome!

And if n0 = 55 we get

       55
       55 +  55 = 110
      110 + 011 = 121,   a palindrome!

Notice that the check for a palindrome happens   after   an addition.



Some starting numbers seem to go on forever; the recurrence relation for 196 has been calculated for millions of repetitions forming numbers with millions of digits, without forming a palindrome.

These numbers that do not end in a palindrome are called Lychrel numbers.

For the purposes of this task a Lychrel number is any starting number that does not form a palindrome within 500 (or more) iterations.



Seed and related Lychrel numbers

Any integer produced in the sequence of a Lychrel number is also a Lychrel number.

In general, any sequence from one Lychrel number might converge to join the sequence from a prior Lychrel number candidate; for example the sequences for the numbers 196 and then 689 begin:

        196
        196 +    691 =   887
        887 +    788 =  1675
       1675 +   5761 =  7436
       7436 +   6347 = 13783
      13783 +  38731 = 52514
      52514 +  41525 = 94039
       ...


        689
        689 +    986 =  1675
       1675 +   5761 =  7436
       ...

So we see that the sequence starting with 689 converges to, and continues with the same numbers as that for 196.

Because of this we can further split the Lychrel numbers into true Seed Lychrel number candidates, and Related numbers that produce no palindromes but have integers in their sequence seen as part of the sequence generated from a lower Lychrel number.



Task

   Find the number of seed Lychrel number candidates and related numbers for n in the range 1..10000 inclusive. (With that iteration limit of 500).
   Print the number of seed Lychrels found; the actual seed Lychrels; and just the number of relateds found.
   Print any seed Lychrel or related number that is itself a palindrome.


Show all output here.

For details of the algorithm refer to MD5 on Wikipedia or the MD5 definition in IETF RFC (1321).

 The implementation needs to implement the key functionality namely producing a correct message digest for an input string. It is not necessary to mimic all of the calling modes such as adding to a digest one block at a time over subsequent calls. 
 In addition to coding and verifying your implementation, note any challenges your language presented implementing the solution, implementation choices made, or limitations of your solution. 
 Solutions on this page should implement MD5 directly and NOT use built in (MD5) functions, call outs to operating system calls or library routines written in other languages as is common in the original MD5 task.
 The following are acceptable:
 An original implementation from the specification, reference implementation, or pseudo-code
 A translation of a correct implementation from another language
 A library routine in the same language; however, the source must be included here.


The solutions shown here will provide practical illustrations of bit manipulation, unsigned integers, working with little-endian data. Additionally, the task requires an attention to details such as boundary conditions since being out by even 1 bit will produce dramatically different results. Subtle implementation bugs can result in some hashes being correct while others are wrong. Not only is it critical to get the individual sub functions working correctly, even small errors in padding, endianness, or data layout will result in failure.
