	// There's nothing to assert here.  The program compiles and runs,
    // which is the only requirement for this "empty" program.
    // The mere presence of this test function ensures it's testable.

	// If we wanted to be overly pedantic (which is often a good thing in tests!),
	// we could perhaps check if main returns (though this is implicit):
    // However, there's no practical way to do that for a main function.
